  description: After identifying the companies' core strengths, we decided to establish a new path for creative business IP within the blockchain economy as our market strategy direction. This led us to restructure the business logic into two major segments Art IP Incubation and NFT (Non-fungible Token) Asset Issuance, on which we built a solid business model and provided visual presentation recommendations. To support this model, we facilitated connections with platform resources, ultimately establishing strategic partnerships with over 30 companies. In terms of media marketing, we published Weibo posts about the original series IP “Elite Wolves,” each garnering more than 100,000 views, and capitalized on the AI painting trend by posting content that attracted over 130,000 views on a single Xiaohongshu post. Additionally, we participated in NFT projects such as MARADONA ASS and Meelier MIGU, which were part of China Mobile MiGu's initiatives.
